## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#CHALLENGES

Problem 1: I had an issue at first tyring to figure out how to figure out the probability of getting more than 8 calls. I couldn't figure out how to properly type it out. I ended up searching on google how to write this command in R. 

Problem 2: In general, I had issues making the plots. I think the issue I had was that I was typing everything out manually rather than copy and pasting, and I kept running into errors. Eventually, I figured out what was wrong, it usually ended up being a matter of forgetting a parentheses or quotation mark.
